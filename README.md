•	The aim of this project was to implement a classifier and predict spam using TensorFlow library
•	I implemented a 1D CNN with 3 hidden layers and 1 fully connected layer. I used ReLu between the layers and at the end I used softmax as activation function.
•	I obtained a 99% validation accuracy and 98% test accuracy.
